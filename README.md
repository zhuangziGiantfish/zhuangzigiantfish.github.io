# Chupei Wang — GitHub Pages Site

Minimal, accessible, project-oriented personal site.

## Quick start

1. Create a new GitHub repository (public). You can name it anything, or use the special form `chupeiwang.github.io` for a user site.
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repo root. Keep `index.html` at the top-level.
3. (Optional) Add your `cv.pdf` to the repo root and update the link in `index.html` (search for "Download CV").
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set the branch to `main` (or `master`) and root to `/ (root)`.
5. Wait ~1–2 minutes; your site will be live at the Pages URL.
6. Replace placeholder text in `project-pi.html` and `project-ranking.html` and add any images to `assets/`.

## Editing

- Open `index.html` and update About, Past Work, and add links (GitHub, Scholar, etc.).
- Keep the design minimal; colors and typography are controlled in `assets/style.css` via CSS variables.

## Notes

- This site does not use Jekyll; it's plain HTML/CSS for simplicity.
- Accessibility considerations: semantic headings, sufficient contrast, prefers-color-scheme support.
